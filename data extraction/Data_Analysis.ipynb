The subject was intended to symbolically extols the Emperor's peaceful policies that led to prosperity and the flourishing of learning and the arts. The allegorical, encoded content, the unstable composition with movement along the diagonal, the aristocratic elongation of the figure, the cold tone of the picture, elements of eroticism and disturbing lighting are all features of the Rudolfine artistic circle that eclectically combined features of Italian and Low Countries Mannerism.\"]"
